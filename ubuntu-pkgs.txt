Description : Emulator is a QEMU-based device-emulation tool that contains the full stack of the Tizen 2.3 platform. Without a real device, you can test Tizen applications on the emulator instance in your computer. The instance offers virtual H/W keys and a context-menu by which you can easily execute several features. By using ECP (Emulator Control Panel), you can inject virtual events like battery level, sensor, location, battery, etc. into the instance.
 To install the emulator, administrator privileges are required because the emulator needs kernel modules, such as Intel® HAXM (Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager) and etc., which make the emulator run faster. And the emulator also requires up-to-date graphic driver which the vendor provides.
 .
 Some of the key changes in the 2.3 Emulator are:
 * New Emulator Control Panel (ECP), which replaces the Event Injector in the previous version, has been added.
 * EventCast, which enables you to inject sensor and touch events more intuitively by means of a real target, has been added.
 * HD (720x1280) resolution density has been changed to 306
 .
 * If you want more information, see Tizen 2.3 release notes.

Description : Emulator is a QEMU-based device-emulation tool that contains the full stack of the Tizen 2.3.1 platform. Without a real device, you can test Tizen applications on the emulator instance in your computer. The instance offers virtual H/W keys and a context-menu by which you can easily execute several features. By using ECP (Emulator Control Panel), you can inject virtual events like battery level, sensor, location, battery, etc. into the instance.
 To install the emulator, administrator privileges are required because the emulator needs kernel modules, such as Intel® HAXM (Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager) and etc., which make the emulator run faster. And the emulator also requires up-to-date graphic driver which the vendor provides.
 .
 Some of the key changes in the 2.3.1 Emulator are:
 * 360 * 360 and circular wearable emulators have been added.
 * Virtual hardware key which functions like a back button, has been added to the circular wearable emulator.

Description : Emulator is a QEMU-based device-emulation tool that contains the full stack of the Tizen 2.4 platform. Without a real device, you can test Tizen applications on the emulator instance in your computer. The instance offers virtual H/W keys and a context-menu by which you can easily execute several features. By using ECP (Emulator Control Panel), you can inject virtual events like battery level, sensor, location, battery, etc. into the instance.
 To install the emulator, administrator privileges are required because the emulator needs kernel modules, such as Intel® HAXM (Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager) and etc., which make the emulator run faster. And the emulator also requires up-to-date graphic driver which the vendor provides.
 .
 Some of the key changes in the 2.4 Emulator are:
 * SMP with CPU VT acceleration is enabled for enhancing performance.
 * OpenGL ES 3.0 is supported.
 * Multi-touch simulation has been added. Multi-touch drag and pinch-zoom gestures are also supported.
 .
 * If you want more information, see Tizen 2.4 release notes.
